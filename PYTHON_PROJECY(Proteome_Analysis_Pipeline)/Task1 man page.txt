NAME

	Group5_task1 â€” Find all the possible open reading frames (ORFs) from fasta format files

SYNOPSIS

	Group5_task1 [-h help] -i inputs -o output [-l orflength] [-f frame] [-a author]

DESCRIPTION

	Group5_task1 is a program which is able to extract all the possible open reading frames (ORFs) from fasta format files containing one or more than one genome sequence. Group5_task1 the first task in BIOL60201 Project 1 and is followed by Group5_task2, Group5_task3 and Group5_task4 to perform the Python Proteome Analysis Pipeline as a whole.

OPTIONS

[-h], --help

	Show this help message and exit

-i, --inputs

	One or more genome sequence file, comma separate more than one fasta file
	The fasta file should contain nucleotide sequence. Inputs is used to extract genome sequence and genome the species name. In this case, input is mandatory.

-o, --output

	ORF sequence file
	Defines the name of the output.

[-l], --orflength

	Minimum length of ORF
	ORFs should be long enough to encode a typical protein, therefore, an ORF should have a minimal length, eg.at least 150 nucleotides (50 amino acids). The unit of ORF length in the parameter is "base pair". The  default parameter for the minimum size of ORF is 300 bp (100 amino acids).

[-f], --frame

	Set which the reading frame to output
	The default parameter of "-f" contains six reading frames (expressed as "123456"): three on the positive strand, and three (which are read in the reverse direction) on the negative strand. It should be in "str" type. "123" represents 3 ORFs on the positive strand, while "456" represents ORFs on negative strand.

[-a], --author

	Display the author's name

EXAMPLES

	To get ORFs longer than 500 nucleotides from file "genome.fasta":
		Group5_task1.py -i genome.fasta -o orfextract.fasta -l 500

	To get ORFs from two fasta formate files ("genome.fasta" and "sequence.fasta"):
		Group5_task1.py -i genome.fasta,sequence.fasta -o orfextract.fasta 

	To extract ORFs from positive strand DNA:
		Group5_task1.py -i genome.fasta -o orfextract.fasta -f 123
